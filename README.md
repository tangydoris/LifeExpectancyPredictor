Life Expectancy Predictor as a whole is an iOS application where the platform Docker bridges the front end and the back end (this project). It uses IBM Watson's Alchemy and Personality Insights API's to gauge a user's Twitter tweets. Based on the two assessments, a certain amount of time is added or subtracted from the user's normal expected longevity depending on whether the user has a positive or negative outlook/attittude. The expected longevity is calculated from age, gender and location.
